# Résumé d'hunghg255

This is my Résumé generator. You can check out my Résumé [here](https://hunghg-resume.vercel.app/).

The theme is heavy modified from [jsonresume-theme-kwan](https://github.com/icoloma/jsonresume-theme-kwan).

## How it works

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/hunghg255/62e9b8a643b39a04a73096d998f9da70) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) with CI/CD.
- HTML is generated with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and PDF is printed with [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/).

> Note: I did a lot quick hacks to make it suitable for my design, which may not be good to be general used as a theme. While I may not have time to improve it, PRs are great welcome!
